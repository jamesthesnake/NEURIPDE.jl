# Deep Forward-Backwards SDEs for Terminal Parabolic PDEs

To solve high-dimensional PDEs, one should first describe the PDE in terms of
the `TerminalPDEProblem` with constructor:

```julia
TerminalPDEProblem(g,f,μ_f,σ_f,X0,tspan,p=nothing)
```

which describes the semilinear parabolic PDE of the form:

![paraPDE](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1814174/63212617-48980480-c0d5-11e9-9fec-0776117464c7.PNG)

with terminating condition `u(tspan[2],x) = g(x)`. These methods solve the PDE in
reverse, satisfying the terminal equation and giving a point estimate at
`u(tspan[1],X0)`. The dimensionality of the PDE is determined by the choice
of `X0`, which is the initial stochastic state.

To solve this PDE problem, there exist two algorithms:

- `NNPDENS(u0,σᵀ∇u;opt=Flux.ADAM(0.1))`: Uses a neural stochastic differential
  equation, which is then solved by the methods available in DifferentialEquations.jl.
  The `alg` keyword is required for specifying the SDE solver algorithm that
  will be used on the internal SDE. All of the other keyword arguments are passed
  to the SDE solver.
- `NNPDEHan(u0,σᵀ∇u;opt=Flux.ADAM(0.1))`: Uses the stochastic RNN algorithm
  [from Han](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/34/8505). Only applicable when
  `μ_f` and `σ_f` result in a non-stiff SDE where low order non-adaptive time
  stepping is applicable.

Here, `u0` is a Flux.jl chain with a `d`-dimensional input and a 1-dimensional output.
For `NNPDEHan`, `σᵀ∇u` is an array of `M` chains with a `d`-dimensional input and a
`d`-dimensional output, where `M` is the total number of timesteps. For `NNPDENS`
it is a `d+1`-dimensional input (where the final value is time) and a `d`-dimensional
output. `opt` is a Flux.jl optimizer.

Each of these methods has a special keyword argument `pabstol`, which specifies
an absolute tolerance on the PDE's solution, and will exit early if the loss
reaches this value. Its default value is `1f-6`.
