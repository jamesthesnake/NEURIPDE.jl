# ODE-Specialized Physics-Informed Neural Solver

The ODE-specialized physics-informed neural network (PINN) solver is a
method for the [DifferentialEquations.jl common interface](https://diffeq.sciml.ai/latest/)
of `ODEProblem`, which generates the solution via a neural network.
Thus the standard [ODEProblem](https://diffeq.sciml.ai/latest/types/ode_types/)
is used, but a new algorithm, `NNODE`, is used to solve the problem.

The algorithm type is:

```julia
nnode(chain,opt)
```

where `chain` is a DiffEqFlux `sciml_train`-compatible Chain or FastChain
representing a neural network, and `opt` is an optimization method
for `sciml_train`. For more details, see [the DiffEqFlux documentation
on `sciml_train`](https://diffeqflux.sciml.ai/dev/).
